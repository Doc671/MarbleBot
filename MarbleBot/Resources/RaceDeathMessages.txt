was flung away by a spinner
was too slow to get into the bowl
kept getting hit by other marbles
glitched out
got scared, rolled away
missed the shooter
teleported to the start
fell behind the other marbles
ricocheted off the wall
was not Approved by Orange
lacked the will to go on
realized in +inf
got stuck
flew off the screen
was voted out
was beaten by the boss
ran out of time
went backwards
ingested too much Poup Soop
disconnected
caused Algodoo to lag
was deleted by Algodoo
got defenestrated
failed as badly as Sand Dollar
somehow broke the law
self-destructed
was not a marble
