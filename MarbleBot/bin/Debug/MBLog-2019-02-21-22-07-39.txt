[2019-02-21 22:11:19] Doc671#1965: mb/update minor **__Siege updates!__**
- New bosses: Help Me the Tree, erangO and Octopheesh! Use `mb/siege boss <boss name>` to find out more!
- Status effects! The new bosses have a few attacks that can inflict them!
-- **CHILL** - makes all your attacks deal half damage for the rest of the battle.
-- **DOOM** - kills you after ~45 seconds.
-- **POISON** - damages you every ~15 seconds until you're at 1 HP.
-- **STUN** - prevents you from attacking for ~15 seconds.
- New power-up: **Cure** - gets rid of any status effects you have!
- The way the boss is chosen has changed slightly. The more contestants there are, the more likely it is for a harder boss to appear.
